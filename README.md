# microbit-project-1
I added the Lizard and Spock to the standard format of rps
Nothing uniuqe was added on other then that and a shake command to randomize

Problem I may have run into is breaking im not sure if the breaks in my code will make the image stop early or continue showing until next shake
I may tinker with the code to have certain notes go along with each creature but that will be once i get my hands on the full micro bit
